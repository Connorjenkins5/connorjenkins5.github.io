    <h3>About me</h3>
    <h4>Hi, I'm Connor</h4>
    <p>I'm 27 and from a small village in Wales. I'm a father of 2 beautiful girls and 2 big puppies. I currently work as an RPA Developer with the hope of progressing into a software engineer role in the next few years. Please take the time to go through my website and get to know me a little bit.</p>

          <h2>Football</h2>
          <p>I've been a huge football fan from around the age of 6. Much to the disappointment of my father who lives and breathes Rugby. I support Manchester United which I’m proud to say the majority of the time when were not getting beat 7-0 by Liverpool or 6-3 by Manchester City. I’ve played at grass roots level for as long as I can remember and I know I may not be the most gifted player but I definitely get an A* for effort.</p>

          <h2>Jiu Jitsu</h2>
          <p>I done Kickboxing for quite a while growing up, even managed to get a brown belt however I was 12 so that doesn’t really count anymore. Around a year ago I took up MMA in particular Jiu Jitsu. After being tapped out over and over again until I finally began to start getting some small wins. I really enjoyed Jiu Jitsu and was going 4/5 times a week, I even considered packing football in to focus more on BJJ to maybe start competing but I broke my middle finger and thought it would be a good idea to splint it myself but meant it hasn’t healed correctly and now I’m on the never ending waiting list for a GP to help get it sorted. So for now, my BJJ career is on hold until I can at least hold a pen correctly and then back to being tapped out every 30 seconds.</p>

        <h2> Current - Automation Engineer</h2>
        <p>I currently work as an Automation Engineer. My main responsibilities are to find workflows within the business and automate them. I can do this in a series of ways whether it’s through Blue Prism, Power Automate, Python or Bash. The purpose of my job is to save the company time and money on man hours and utilising Bots/Runners to do those jobs. These jobs can then be run anytime of the day for as long as needed unattended. All that money saved means the company can reinvest it into the network and to upskill staff and provide better opportunities.</p>

            <h2>Website</h2>
            <p>As you can see I have developed my own personal website. With the usage of HTML, CSS and JavaScript I have been able to put together a basic website all about myself. I have displayed some of my skills and current certifications that I have gotten on my web development journey, I will be adding a Blog function my Twitter feed integration and also adding results from Rassau AFC (my football team) Manchester United's results, the Premier league table, Minnesota Vikings results and maybe a widget for the UFC bouts involving some of my favourite fighters.</p>
